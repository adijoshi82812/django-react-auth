# Simple Authentication system
## About the project
This project is written in python-django at backend and reactjs to handle the frontend. \
I have used a simple basic authentication system without any validation. \
Feel free to add validations in your project. \

**Note** : I Have deleted the css library, if you want the same output just add w3.css framework from https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/4/w3.css
